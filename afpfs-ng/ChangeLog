August 25, 2007

Added somewhat more correct gid handling.

Fixed up mknod uid/gid handling.

Some comments on uid/gid mapping.

The following only matters for mapping login ids.

gid handling seems to be handled somewhat differently between servers.  When
doing a getuserinfo with the GROUPID bit set, you get:
- 10.4.7 replies with the field, but it contains junk
- Other mac os x and Airport 7.1.1 replies with an empty field
- netatalk fills it in as expected

Furthermore, it doesn't matter what you do with chgrp (or chmod or probably
chown) on an Airport, all files are owned by 0.0, 0777.

August 24, 2007
- added up some uid/gid debugging

August 18, 2007
