This is a quick guide on how to install afpfs-ng.

To get running:

1. Requirements

a) Linux
- libgcrypt, libgmp for the encrypted login methods
- readline for the command line client
- libfuse (2.7.0 or later) for the FUSE client

b) FreeBSD
- libgcrypt (1.4.0 or later), libgmp for the encrypted login methods
- libfuse (2.7.0 or later) for the untested FUSE client
- iconv

You'll want to configure with: 
CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure

Testing is currently very weak.

c) Mac OS X

You'll need the developer kit and need to manually compile and install libgcrypt.
Only the command line client works.

Testing is currently very weak.

2. Compile afpfs-ng

tar -xzf afpfs-ng-0.8.tar.bz2
cd afpfs-ng-0.8.
./configure
make install

3. Running the FUSE client

This will let you mount remote filesystems. 

As the user who will be needing to access, the file, run the management daemon
by running:

afpfsd

This should fork off.  You should see messages in /var/log/messages.  For more
details, run it with the '-d' option to see detailed debug info.

To mount a filesystem:

mount_afp "afp://username:password@servername/volumename" <mountpoint>

After this, you should be able to access files on <mountpoint>.

You can see status by running 'afp_client status'.  See afp_client(1) for more info.

4. Running the command line client

There are two modes:

a) interactive mode

afpcmd is a command line tool like an FTP client.

Just run:

afpcmd "afp://username:password@servername/volumename"

(if you enter no volumename, it shows which ones are available.  If you 
provide no URL, you can use 'connect'. If you provide a '-' as the
password, you will be prompted for one interactively)

Available commands are:
get <filename>: retrieves the filename
get -r <dirname>: recursively retrieves the directory and its contents
put <filename>: send the file
dir: show directory listings

Others are available too; touch, chmod, chown, del, rename, etc.  See 
afpcmd(1) for more.

b) batch transfer

This will let you quickly transfer one file or recursively a directory,
and then return you to the command prompt.

Eg. 
> afpcmd afp://user:pass@server/alexdevries/linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
Connected to server Cubalibre using UAM "DHX2"
Connected to volume alexdevries
    Getting file /linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
