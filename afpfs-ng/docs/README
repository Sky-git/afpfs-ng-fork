This is a quick guide on how to use the two different afp clients 
in afpfs-ng.


1. The FUSE client

This will let you mount remote filesystems. 

As the user who will be needing to access, the file, run the management daemon
by running:

afpfsd

This should fork off.  You should see messages in /var/log/messages.  For more
details, run it with the '-d' option to see detailed debug info.

To mount a filesystem:

mount_afp "afp://username:password@servername/volumename" <mountpoint>

After this, you should be able to access files on <mountpoint>.

You can see status by running 'afp_client status'.  See afpfsd(1), 
mount_afp(1) and afp_client(1) for more info.

To add an AFP mount to fstab so it mounts automatically on boot:

a. create a file called '/etc/fuse.conf' with one line: 
user_allow_other

b. make sure that any user doing a mount is a member of the group 'fuse' so it can read and write to /dev/fuse

c. create an entry in /etc/fstab entry in the following format:
afpfs#afp://username:mypass10.211.55.2/alexdevries /tmp/xa20 fuse user=adevries,group=fuse 0 0 

Here, username and mypass are the login information on the server 10.211.55.2.
The volume name is alexdevries.  /tmp/xa20 is the name of the mountpoint.  
The user= field is the local user, group needs to be the same the group owner of /dev/fuse (which is typically fuse).

Yes, you will need to put your password in clear text.  There is currently no facility to handle open directory.  Patches welcome. 

2. Running the command line client

There are two modes:

a) interactive mode

afpcmd is a command line tool like an FTP client.

Just run:

afpcmd "afp://username:password@servername/volumename"

(if you enter no volumename, it shows which ones are available.  If you 
provide no URL, you can use 'connect'. If you provide a '-' as the
password, you will be prompted for one interactively)

Available commands are:
get <filename>: retrieves the filename
get -r <dirname>: recursively retrieves the directory and its contents
put <filename>: send the file
dir: show directory listings

Others are available too; touch, chmod, chown, del, rename, etc.  See 
afpcmd(1) for more.

b) batch transfer

This will let you quickly transfer one file or recursively a directory,
and then return you to the command prompt.

Eg. 
> afpcmd afp://user:pass@server/alexdevries/linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
Connected to server Cubalibre using UAM "DHX2"
Connected to volume alexdevries
    Getting file /linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
Transferred 39172170 bytes in 2.862 seconds. (13687 kB/s)

See afpcmd(1) for more information.

c) getting status

You can get status information on servers with 'afpgetstatus <servername>'.  
This provides some information without having to log in.

See afpgetstatus(1) for more information.
