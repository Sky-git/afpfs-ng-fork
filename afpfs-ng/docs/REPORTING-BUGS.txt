This quick document describes how to gather debugging information for afpfs-ng.

Thank you for contributing to the project by submitting a bug report!  This
software's quality is heavily influenced by reported bugs.  We will help 
you as best we can.

Before we start:
- be aware of sending confidential information over the wire and saving it in 
  your logs
- more information may be required, but this is a good start


A. Problems with afpcmd
-----------------------

This should be the first thing to try.

1. Start a network dump

You can run the following on Mac OS X, Linux or other systems.  You can do this
on either the client, server, or a system that sits in between the client and
server.  You'll need root access.

Run:

       tcpdump -s0 -w my_network_capture port 548

There are other tools to do this, like wireshare/ethereal.  Use those if it is
easier, but save it in a tcpdump format.

Keep this running in a window until after you've shown the bug.

2. Perform your operation

Use afpcmd to connect, authenticate, transfer, etc.

Save the console contents to a file called my_command.txt.

3. Mail a copy of the console and network capture.

Tar up all the relevant files with something like:

	tar -czf my_afpfsd_bug.tar.gz \
		my_network_capture my_debug_log my_status my_command.txt

Write an email message with a description of the problem.  There are two 
places to email this:
a) afpfs-ng-devel@lists.sourceforge.net (preferred)
b) alexthepuffin@gmail.com



B. For problems with the FUSE client
------------------------------------

1. Kill off any lingering versions of afpfsd


By default, a process called afpfsd runs in the background, you may have one
lingering.

To do this, start with:

       killall afpfsd

If the process still exists (use 'ps aux |grep afpfsd' to check), be
rutheless:

       killall -9 afpfsd

2. Rerun afpfsd in debug mode

Run:

       afpfsd -d > my_debug_log

This will record lots of logging output to a file.  Keep this running in a 
window.


3. Start a network dump

(as above)


4. Setup the mount

How you setup the mount is dependent on your environment.  Run your 
'afp_client mount ...' command and copy it into a file called my_command.txt

5. Grab the status output

Get the status with:

       afp_client status > my_status

This will exit quickly.

6. Rerun whatever causes the problem

7. Send off a bug report

Kill the tcpdump and afpfsd processes.

Tar up all the relevant files with something like:

	tar -czf my_afpfsd_bug.tar.gz \
		my_network_capture my_debug_log my_status my_command.txt

Write an email message with a description of the problem.  There are two 
places to email this:
a) afpfs-ng-devel@lists.sourceforge.net (preferred)
b) alexthepuffin@gmail.com
