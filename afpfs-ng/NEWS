What is new in afpfs-ng-0.8.1, March 8, 2008
--------------------------------------------

1. Read only support

You can mount volumes readonly with:
mount_afp -o ro afp://username:password@hostname/volumename /mountpoint

Per request from various people.

2. @ and : in passwords and usernames

For one @ in a password, use:
p@@ssword

For one : in a username, use:
user::name

Per request from Niclas Helbro.

3. Fstab

You can now automatically mount volumes in on boot with a line in fstab. 
See docs/README, there are some simple but specific instructions.


What is new in afpfs-ng-0.8, February 18, 2008
----------------------------------------------

1. New command line (non-FUSE) tools:

a) batch mode of afpcmd

This lets you do simple transfers, eg. 

> afpcmd afp://user:pass@server/alexdevries/linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
Connected to server Cubalibre using UAM "DHX2"
Connected to volume alexdevries
    Getting file /linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
Transferred 39172170 bytes in 2.862 seconds. (13687 kB/s)

b) interactive mode of afpcmd

This is file transfer tool similiar to an ftp client.  Has (local) filename 
completion and command history.

c) get status tool, afpgetstatus

A simple tool to get the status information of a server without logging in.


2. FUSE client improvements

Continuation of FUSE client development, including the introduction of a new tool
called mount_afp, which has the same syntax as in Mac OS X.  Better status and 
post-deployment debugging, proper forced or unforced exit and other bugs.


3. Protocol fixes

Many protocol enhancements and bug fixes, including: support for AFP 2.x, multiple 
servers, session keys, signatures, meta information, chmod and chown fixes.  
Tested against Mac OS X, OS9, Airport and netatalk.

File transfer performance is now similiar or faster to Mac OS X.


4. Development library

The source code of afpfs-ng has now been changed to a library (libafpclient) and
support for multiple clients (examples are FUSE, afpcmd, afpgetstatus).  With this
library, more AFP clients (GIO, KIO) can be built with limited pain.  This API is
not yet stabilized.

5. Other

FUSE client fully validated on Linux, builds on FreeBSD.
Command line client builds and runs on Linux, runs but is weakly tested on FreeBSD 
and Mac OS X.

There are manpages.


What is new in afpfs-ng-0.4.3, September 8, 2007
------------------------------------------------

New features in this release include:

- UTF8 internationalization of filenames, volumes and servers, mostly written by Michael Ulbrich

- proper uid/gid mapping to enable environments with a common or different user directory

- DHX2 UAM from Derrik Pates

- fixes to deal with the Apple Airport Extreme quirks

- fixes to deal with netatalk quirks

- improved status output for debugging

- various small bug fixes (Paul Borman, Volker Grabsch)


This is the last release before a rework that introduces libafpclient to 
handle multiple clients.

You can get afpfs-ng from http://afpfs-ng.sourceforge.net .







What is new in afpfs-0.4, Feburary 11, 2007
-------------------------------------------

We're happy to release version 0.4 of afpfs-ng, the Apple Filing Protocol client
for Linux with FUSE.

New features include:

- stability: afpfs-ng is reliable to the point of being usable for all but
  the most strenuous IO loads

- encrypted authentication mechanisms: now also supporting Randnum, 2-way
  randnum, DHCAST128 and DHX2

- performance: DID caching, enhanced DSI packet processing and other
  improvements make afpfs-ng about half as fast as the Mac OS X client

- ease of use: unmounting, SIGINT, easier logging, easier startup, better
  docs, session suspension

For more information and to download, see http://afpfs-ng.sf.net/.




What is new in 0.3, Nov. 27, 2006
---------------------------------
* many, many memory leaks fixed with some help from valgrind and close inspection
* fixed many segfaults from null pointer dereferencing
* heap corruption fixed
* server version matching works now (afpfs-ng speaks 3.2 by default)
* more testing against 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and netatalk
* some documentation
* preliminary support for resource forks (although this is still incomplete and broken) 

0.2 had a lot of problems with stability, mostly because of the complex and optimized DSI read code, which does zero-copy reads and handles quantums properly. This appears to be fixed now.

Please, if you've tried afpfs-ng, let me know.  You can subscribe to the mailing list at http://sourceforge.net/projects/afpfs-ng, or mail me at alexthepuffin@gmail.com.


What is new in 0.2, Nov. 20, 2006
---------------------------------

In version 0.2, the project has matured considerably.  You can mount a volume,
see, read and write files with reasonable performance.

* much better testing against 10.3 and 10.4 (speaking AFP 3.1, not 3.2)
* better error handling
* restructured into client/server
* rewrote incoming reads to optimize for read performance.  It works!
* lots and lots of other changes
  - fixed rename, large dids, UTF8 names
* dynamic quantum calculation
* status
* new logging mechanism, forking
* autoconf (sigh)


What is new in 0.1, Oct. 16, 2006
---------------------------------
* it compiles
* it has worked for me, but probably nobody else
