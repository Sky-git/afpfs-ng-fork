These are known bugs in afpfs-ng 0.8:

- if afpfsd isnt' running, and you run an 'afp_client exit', it restarts it
  and then kills it

- files with '/' in them can't be accessed

- for the fuse client, when you have multiple servers that are connected, 
  if you unmount anything other than the last one, you may ruin the 
  other mounts.

- If you're not using a common user directory, chgrp may have problems

- On occasion, when doing a mount with the fuse client, there can be a 
  delay of 10 seconds.

- there are some locking problems with FUSE which can cause a halted
  filesystem under heavy traffic loads

- on Mac OS X, gcrypt 1.4.0 or later is required.  1.2.4 has a dynamic linker
  bug which will break afpfs-ng whenver gcrypt functions are called.

- on file get and put, we don't really pay attention to tx and rx quantums.
  This can make for inefficient transfers.

- FreeBSD has quite a few problems with it; the port is simply incomplete.
  Among the problems:
  - the fuse implementation is totaly untested, you will need to manually
    start up the daemon (afpfsd) 
  - there can be some long delays when initiating connections

- on some clients, such as afpgetstatus, ^C won't work

- file names are limited to 255 characters, whereas AFP >= 3.0 handles
  infinite lengths
